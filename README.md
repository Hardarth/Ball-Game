# Ball-Game
This Java program is a basic implementation of the Atari Breakout game. Players control a paddle to bounce a ball, break bricks, and score points. The game includes features like adjustable ball speed, a target square for bonus points, saving and displaying high scores, and game restart using the space bar.
